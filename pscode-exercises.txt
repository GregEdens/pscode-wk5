// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Get user input, two integers (store in two seperate variables

execute calculation first integer + second integer upon input

print result to the terminal screen

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Get user input, score integer in a variable

main program takes that variable value and /2.
If result is a whole number, prints Even to the terminal screen
else result is a !whole, prints odd to the screen

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Get user input stored into a list of 5 integer values.
Program executes upon completion of 5 entered integers by adding the 5 indices of the list and / by 5, storing this information into a variable 'average'
Program then executes a series of if-else statements to determine which number is smaller, comparing the indices with <. Result is stored in a variable 'min'.
Program executes a series of if-else statements to determine which number is greater, comparing the indices value with >. Result is stored in a variable 'max'.
Print result to terminal screen "Average:" followed by average variable value
Print result to the terminal screen "Minimum: " follwed by the min variable value.
Print result to the terminal screen "Maximum: " followed by the max variable value.
